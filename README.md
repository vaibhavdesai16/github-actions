# Code Freeze PR Blocker GitHub Action

This GitHub Action is designed to block pull requests (PRs) from being merged during a specified code freeze period. This ensures that no new code changes are introduced into the codebase during critical times, such as before a major release or during holidays.

## Features

- Automatically blocks PR merges during a specified date range.
- Customizable freeze period and bypass conditions.
- Provides clear messages to PR authors about the code freeze policy.

## Usage

To use this GitHub Action, add it to your repository's workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/block-prs.yml`).

### Example Workflow File

```yaml
name: Code Freeze PR Blocker

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited, synchronize]

jobs:
  block-prs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Block PRs during code freeze
      uses: ./.github/actions/block-prs
      with:
        start-date: "2024-12-20"
        end-date: "2025-01-05"
        timezone: "UTC"
```

### Inputs

| Name         | Description                                                | Required | Default      |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------|--------------|
| `start-date` | Start date of the code freeze in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.       | Yes      | N/A          |
| `end-date`   | End date of the code freeze in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.         | Yes      | N/A          |
| `timezone`   | Timezone for the freeze period (e.g., `UTC`, `America/NY`). | No       | `UTC`        |

### Outputs

None.

## How It Works

1. The action checks if the current date falls within the specified freeze period.
2. If the date is within the freeze period, the action:
   - Fails the workflow.
   - Posts a comment on the PR, notifying the author about the code freeze.

## Customization

You can customize the action further by editing the script to include additional bypass rules, such as allowing PRs from certain users or for specific labels.

## Example Comment

If a PR is blocked, the action will post a comment like this:

> ðŸš« Code Freeze Alert: Pull requests are not allowed to be merged between `2024-12-20` and `2025-01-05`. Please wait until the freeze period ends to merge this PR.

## Development

To modify this action, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Update the script in `.github/actions/block-prs`.
3. Test the changes locally or with a test repository.
4. Push updates to the main branch.
